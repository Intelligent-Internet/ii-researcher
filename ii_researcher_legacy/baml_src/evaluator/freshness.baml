### Implementation Notes:
1. **Contextual Adjustment**: Freshness requirements may change during crises or rapid developments in specific domains.
2. **Tiered Approach**: Consider implementing urgency levels (critical, important, standard) alongside age thresholds.
3. **User Preferences**: Allow customization of thresholds for specific query types or user needs.
4. **Source Reliability**: Pair freshness metrics with source credibility scores for better quality assessment.
5. **Domain Specificity**: Some specialized fields (medical research during pandemics, financial data during market volatility) may require dynamically adjusted thresholds.
6. **Geographic Relevance**: Regional considerations may alter freshness requirements for local regulations or events.

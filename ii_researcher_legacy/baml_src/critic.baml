At step 1, you took the **search** action and looked for external information for the question: "What is the net worth of the SpaceX founder?".
In particular, you tried to search for the following keywords: "SpaceX founder net worth".
You found quite some information and add them to your URL list and **visit** them later when needed.

At step 2, you took the **visit** action and deep dive into the following URLs:
https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk
https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires
You found some useful information on the web and add them to your knowledge for future reference.

<output>
Initial search and visit actions have gathered basic information about Elon Musk's net worth from Forbes and Bloomberg, showing significant fluctuations tied to Tesla stock performance with a current estimate around $180 billion as of 2023. The available information provides a good starting point but has several limitations: the data is from 2023 and may be outdated, the net worth calculation is heavily dependent on Tesla stock value, and there's no information about SpaceX's specific contribution to the net worth. Key gaps include current net worth as of 2024, breakdown of assets beyond Tesla stock, SpaceX's specific valuation and Musk's ownership percentage, and impact of recent market changes. To address these gaps, we should search for more recent net worth data from 2024, look for detailed asset breakdowns from financial reports, find SpaceX valuation information and Musk's ownership stake, and check for any recent significant changes in Tesla stock or SpaceX valuation.

        question "List 10 Catholic movies in the last 5 years with imdb score greater than 7"
        answer "After conducting extensive research across multiple Catholic film lists and databases (including IMDb and the National Catholic Register), I have determined that there isn't an established list of 10 Catholic movies released in the last five years (i.e. 2020â€“2025) that all have IMDb scores above 7. Most curated lists cover films from a broad historical range, and only a very few recent films satisfy both the modern release window and the rating threshold. For instance, the film *Jesus Revolution* (2023) is one notable example that meets the criteria, while other prominent Catholic films tend to be either older or have lower IMDb scores. As such, based on reliable sources, the criteria yield a very limited number of candidates and a complete list of 10 could not be verified."
